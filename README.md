# Docker image for calcite packages

This repository provides a Docker image for the **calcite** package, building on top of our [**alabaster** image](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/alabaster-docker). 
It is primarily intended for CI/CD but could also be used for interactive experimentation with the **calcite** system.
Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/calcite-docker/pkgs/container/calcite-docker%2Fbuilder) to pull the image from GitHub's container registry.
